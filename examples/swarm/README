This demo creates a web server that hosts a one-page
application with no HTML UI, but adds several global objects
to the JavaScript execution context that can be manipulated
in the browser's JavaScript console or inspector.

Each web browser hosts an object.  The server hosts an
object with references to every connected browser's local
object, with a unique identifier for each connection.

Every client can query the list of connected objects by
issuing a Q.keys(remote) request.  They can then get a far
reference to any other web browser's hosted object by call
Q.get(remote, key).

Each client can add capabilities to their local object like,
a logging method to receive messages from other peers.

    Q.put(local, 'log', console.log.bind(console));

Then, other folks can send messages like:

    var other = Q.get(remote, otherKey);
    Q.post(other, 'log', 'Hello!');
